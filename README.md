# Final_proyect_Back
Final project fom a 1200 hours bootcamp in web development in https://codehouse.academy/

This is the backend for a Mvp developed for a real company called Jammer. It is a centralized platform to get in touch Owners, tenants and refurbishment professionals. 

Backend developed with NodeJs, with a MySQL database and using Firebase for the real time chat and to allow the upload of documentas such as ID, Rental agreement and so on. Each house will have its own files which are independant from each other so the Owner have access to all documents from all different houses and tenants will only have access to documents uploaded to the house they are living in.
