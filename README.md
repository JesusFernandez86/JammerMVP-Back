# Final_proyect_Back
Final project Backend for Jammer startup, I have used

Backend developed with NodeJs, with a MySQL database and using Firebase for the real time chat and to allow the upload of documentas such as ID, Rental agreement and so on. Each house will have its own files which are independant from each other so the Owner have access to all documents from all different houses and tenants will only have access to documents uploaded to the house they are living in.
